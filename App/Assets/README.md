# Assets Folder

This folder is where **all application assets** should be placed.

Files in this directory will be automatically copied to the build output under:

%{cfg.targetdir}/App/Assets/

Please add any resources such as images, fonts, sounds, or other data files here to ensure they are included correctly in the application's final build.
